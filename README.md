# UFOs

## Overview
For this project, I created a website using HTML/CSS and bootstrap in order to display data from a js file. I also JavaScript to add the data to the website in a table format.

## Results


## Summary

One drawback is that the sightings are only from the US. If we were to obtain the sightings data from other parts of the world, it is possible that the results would be skewed.

One recommendation is to gather more data from the internet to address this issue. A second recommendation would be to have the website in different languages, in order to make it more accessible to a larger public.
